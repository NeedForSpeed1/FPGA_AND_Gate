# FPGA_AND_Gate

FPGA: BASYS3

Tools/Language: Vivado Design Suite, Verilog

Description: Built an AND gate. Simulation was successful. Ran on the board succesfully, with Switch 0 and 1 acting as A and B, which light up LED 0 when the output equals 1.

Source: Used Prof. Mughal's online tutorials for setting up the board and gate.
